            <p><strong>Aaron Brenner</strong> is the Associate University Librarian for Digital Scholarship and Creation in the University Library System (ULS) at the University of Pittsburgh. He is responsible for developing, coordinating, and representing the library's expertise in advanced digital technologies, methods, and services in support of research and scholarship. These include data acquisition and analysis, research data management, geographic information systems, digitization and metadata services, support for open access publishing, copyright guidance, electronic journal publishing, digital repository services, the creation and use of digital research collections, scholarly and digital making, and multimedia technologies. His research interests include how people learn and work together in groups (drawing on learning theory, sociology, and related concepts in science and technology studies); library participation in civic open data ecosystems and community-partnered research; programs supporting student research (especially for undergraduates), and the design and use of learning spaces (especially in libraries).</p>

            <p><strong>Matthew J. Lavin</strong> is a Clinical Assistant Professor of English and Director of the Digital Media Lab at the University of Pittsburgh. He earned a PhD in English from the University of Iowa in 2012; a master's degree in American studies at Utah State University in 2006; and a bachelor's degree at St. Lawrence University in 2002. His dissertation, "Collaborative Momentum: The Author and the Middle Man in U.S. Literature and Culture, 1890-1940" examines the supportive and productively adversarial labor of editors, publishers, and other literary go-betweens, as well as how this labor contributed to the construction of modern authorship. From 2012 to 2013, Lavin served as a Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Nebraska â€“ Lincoln's Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. From 2013 to 2015, he was Associate Program Coordinator for the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Initiative "Crossing Boundaries: Re-Envisioning the Humanities for the 21st Century" at St. Lawrence University. Lavin's scholarship focuses on the intersection of digital humanities, book history, and U.S. literature. In 2015, he established <a href="https://humanitiesdata.com">humanitiesdata.com</a> as a curated list of publicly available datasets and corpora of potential interest to computational humanities teachers and scholars. In 2017, Lavin and fellow primary investigators Matt Burton (University of Pittsburgh), Jessica Otis (CMU), and Scott Weingart (CMU) received an 18-month Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant for <a href='https://digits.pub'>Digits: a Platform to Facilitate the Production of Digital Scholarship</a>.</p>
