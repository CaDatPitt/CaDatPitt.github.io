            <div>
              <p>To what degree can reframing how we think about collections as data change the culture that surrounds its production and distribution? This is the central question of our <em>Collections as Data: Part to Whole</em> project, which centers on a collaborative experiment that includes the Archives and Special Collections and the Digital Scholarship Services unit in the University Library System (ULS) and the English Department at the University of Pittsburgh. The project team members have all had prior experience with a methodological pattern of scholarship based on enriching existing library-generated collections data through research-driven, often interpretive, layers of additional data. There is great value in this method, but in practice it is often exceedingly difficult to execute because the workflows and tooling between the library datastores and researchers' access and activity are lacking. Furthermore, there are significant lost opportunities to "close the circle," either by directing appropriate researcher-created description back into library record and/or for the library to support the stewardship and scholarly reach of the newly-created research datasets.</p>

              <p>Our implementation model involves exporting catalog data for target collections that have already been minimally digitized and/or described as collection records. Data will then be imported into a web-based application that will allow undergraduate students in Matt Lavin's "Projects in Digital Composition: Communicating with Data" and "Archival Research Methods" courses to work closely with digital proxies of collections materials and metadata describing those materials. Students will work in teams to label, visualize, and analyze digital objects with increased granularity and critical depth. Since these student engagements are test cases for the kind of collaborative model we envision, library personnel will conduct class visits and work closely with student teams throughout the process. Informed by these experiences, the project team will work together to develop new collections-as-data workflows.</p> 

              <p>Our project specifically targets (collections of) serials and ephemera because the ULS has many such materials, both digitized and non-digitized, in which the voices of marginalized and underrepresented groups are expressed.<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup> These materials are of strong interest to student and faculty researchers looking for inclusive representation because historically, the conditions of their production and reception often made serials and ephemera more desirable venues for specific counterpublics than monograph publication.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> Further, the University of Pittsburgh's default digitization strategy for these materials--like many institutions--has been to represent each issue of a periodical as a single digital object, so there is a substantial opportunity to enrich these objects by physically delineating and bibliographically describing their content. These collections have strong potential to tell as-yet untold stories and to help us teach undergraduates how interpretive research questions and data-driven methods can be used in complementary ways. This model supports broader institutional participation in an open data pipeline or ecosystem that reinforces two crucial principles: 

                <ol>
                  <li>that digitization is enriched by employing a data layering philosophy and </li>
                  <li>that interpretation and analysis of collections data, stated as an explicit objective, can increase institutional commitment to bringing underrepresented histories to light.</li></ol>

            <div name="rationale">
              <h3>Project Rationale</h3>
              <p>This project comes out of a longstanding desire on the part of the project team members to build better collaborative models for analyzing and improving the datasets behind the ULS digital collections. For several years, ULS units, including but not limited to Archives and Special Collections, Cataloguing, Digital Scholarship Services, have been working on a unified platform for digital collections that would facilitate a range of digital projects. Simultaneously, Lavin's scholarship and teaching have focused on cultural analytics approaches to book historical research questions, especially the role of periodicals in the framing of literary taste and prestige. The members of this project team collectively represent an important example of the kinds of stakeholders who might be coming together on a range of collections as data implementations. Our project foremost serves communities of would-be collaborators by contributing to ongoing discussions about how the overlapping goals of teaching, research, and collections development can work in concert to proliferate and enrich digital materials, especially materials highlighting the voices of underrepresented groups, which are often given inadequate attention for structural or systemic reasons.</p> 

              <p>As all this suggests, the project team has already done much of the preliminary work to ensure the success of this particular collaboration. The ULS has completed implementing its digital collections platform, most legacy digital projects have been converted to the new system (see <a href="https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collections">ULS Digital Collections</a> at Pitt), and library staff have already begun to export catalog data in an effort to make it more available to scholars wanting to analyze it. Lavin, meanwhile, has created two new courses in the English department, and both have been approved by the English department and the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. Lavin will teach "Projects in Digital Composition: Communicating with Data" for the second time in Spring 2019, and he will teach the inaugural section of "Archival Research Methods" in Fall 2019 or Spring 2020. In connection with his teaching and research interests, Lavin has experimented extensively with a data-labeling web application, which creates a lightweight, mobile-device compatible front end through which students can interact with more complex datasets.</p>

              <p>The crucial next step for this project is to bring together the important institutional work that the ULS and Lavin have both done independently of one another. Lavin and the ULS have had similar goals, but they are subject to different limitations and advantages. We expect the labor of bringing these disparate models together to be challenging but extremely productive. To facilitate this work, the project team is seeking outside support to fund a graduate assistantship for one year, a course release for Lavin to offset the labor of integrating his data enrichment web application into his courses, and a percentage of Terry Kapral's salary to cover the increased demands this collaboration will place on her time, in the form of  planning, classroom visits, project meetings, and direct support of students working with collections as data materials.</p>

              <h3>Overview of Materials</h3>
              <p>The cultural heritage materials in this project includes a diverse array of serials (e.g., journals, magazines, newspapers, newsletters) and ephemera (e.g., broadsides, flyers, cartoons) that reflect the perspectives of African Americans, American Labor Unionists, American left-wing organizations, the LGBTQ community, and feminists. Some of these materials have been digitized, such as the <em><a href="https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/shooting-star-review">Shooting Star Review</a></em>, a literary magazine that explores the African American experiences through literature and art; materials in the <a href="https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/american-left-ephemera-collection">American Left Ephemera Collection</a>, a variety of textual and visual materials--including periodicals, photographs, letters, pamphlets, posters, flyers, labels, pins, etc--that document left-wing organizations in the U.S. as early as 1890 and during the 20th century; the <a href="https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/communist-collection-ae-forbes">Communist Collection of A.E. Forbes</a>, which contains hand-rendered and mimeographed broadsides, newsletters, and flyers that capture Pittsburgh's radical politics during the 1930s and 1940s; and <a href="https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/fred-wright-cartoons">Fred Wright Cartoons</a>, a collection of thousands of cartoons created between 1939 and 1984 by American labor activist and cartoonist Fred Wright, which reflected the politics and labor issues  of the day and were featured in newspapers and union publications internationally. The majority of these materials, however, have not yet been digitized.</p> 

              <p>The ULS's Archives and Special Collections unit has curated a collection of periodicals and publications that subvert dominant political powers or religious institutions, referred to as <a href="https://pitt.libguides.com/c.php?g=569586&p=3927043">the Underground Press</a>. This collection is comprised of radical publications, student press, socialist press, alternative professional press, LGBTQ press, and feminist press. The library has also collected over a hundred publications that reflect the perspectives of African Americans.</p>

              <h3>Notes</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Serials here refers to any publication issued in successive parts which are intended to be continued indefinitely. We use the term <em>periodicals</em> as a synonym for serials when quoting or paraphrasing scholars who do not distinguish between the two categories.</li>
                <li>There is a preponderance of scholarship on this aspect of serials. Lavin describes some of these connections in his statement of support.</li>
